 * Earlier versions of Express used to have a lot of middleware bundled with it.
 * bodyParser was one of the middlewares that came it.
 * When Express 4.0 was released they decided to remove the bundled middleware from Express and make them separate packages instead.
 * The syntax then changed from app.use(express.json()) to app.use(bodyParser.json()) or app.use(express.urlencoded()) after installing the bodyParser module.
 *
 * bodyParser was added back to Express in release 4.16.0, because people wanted it bundled with Express like before.
 * That means you don't have to use bodyParser.json() anymore if you are on the latest release. You can use express.json() instead.
 * app.use(express.urlencoded()) : decodes "urlencoded" requests (form submissions)
 * app.use(bodyParser.json()) : decodes "json" requests
